## Empowering young 3D artists with a lack of PC performance to Render their Blender Projects

Do you want to render your Blender project as a Animation or Still frame in cycles or any other Render engine? But your pc performance abstract you, right?
<br>
<b>No worries, Google Colab is here you help you. By refering to the above notenook in this repository, your all obstracles will be chased out.</b>

## Primary Instructions to use
<li> Your Blender file is going to be rendered on a data center saver, So you need to pack all the file and textures to your blend file before uploading. ( no need of uploading textures separately
  <br>
  Blender > File > External Data > Pack resources
<li> The create a New folder in Your google drive and upload your blend file there. If you have any simulation data in your blender file, upload the baked simulation data folders along with the blend file to the same folder. Also Remeber to create a Render folder if you willing have the output as a png or jpg sequence. ( otherwise it is not necessary )
<li> After everything is settled up you can open the notebook with the google drive account where you uploaded the files ( The account must be the google drive where your files are in, otherwise you cannot access them in the notebook )
